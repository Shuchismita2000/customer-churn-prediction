# Predicting Customer Churn for a Subscription Service

## Introduction

In today's competitive market, retaining customers is crucial for the success of subscription-based businesses. Customer churn, which refers to the rate at which customers stop subscribing to a service, can significantly impact a company's revenue and growth. Therefore, predicting and understanding the factors that lead to customer churn can help businesses implement effective retention strategies.

In this project, we will embark on a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn. We will use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle for this project. This dataset contains information about a telecommunications company's customers, including their demographic details, account information, and usage patterns. 

Our goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Overview

This project will cover the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data collection to deployment, demonstrating how to handle each stage effectively. Here is a breakdown of the steps we will follow:

1. **Data Collection**: We will start by loading the Telco Customer Churn dataset. This step involves downloading the dataset from Kaggle and exploring its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Next, we will perform EDA to gain insights into the data. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and understanding relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we will transform the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning. This involves selecting relevant features, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
4. **Model Building**: We will build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. We will experiment with different algorithms and use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also visualize the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Tools and Technologies

Throughout this project, we will use the following tools and technologies:

- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **MLflow**: For tracking the experiments and models.
