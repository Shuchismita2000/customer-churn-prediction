    st.header("Introduction")
    st.write("""
    In today's competitive market, retaining customers is crucial for the success of subscription-based businesses. Customer churn, which refers to the rate at which customers stop subscribing to a service, can significantly impact a company's revenue and growth. Therefore, predicting and understanding the factors that lead to customer churn can help businesses implement effective retention strategies.

    In this project, we will embark on an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn. We will use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle for this project. This dataset contains information about a telecommunications company's customers, including their demographic details, account information, and usage patterns. 

    Our goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

    st.subheader("1. Data Collection")
    st.write("""
    We will start by loading the Telco Customer Churn dataset. This step involves downloading the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) and exploring its structure.

    st.subheader("2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)")
    st.write("""
    Next, we will perform EDA to gain insights into the data. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and understanding relationships between features.

    st.subheader("3. Feature Engineering")
    st.write("""
    In this step, we will transform the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning. This involves selecting relevant features, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

    st.subheader("4. Model Building")
    st.write("""
    We will build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. We will experiment with different algorithms and use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

    st.subheader("5. Model Evaluation")
    st.write("""
    After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also visualize the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

    st.subheader("6. Deployment")
    st.write("""
    Finally, we will deploy the model using a web API framework such as Flask. We will containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform.

    st.header("Tools and Technologies")
    st.write("""
    Throughout this project, we will use the following tools and technologies:
    
    - **Pandas and NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
    - **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
    - **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model building and evaluation.
    - **Flask:** For creating the web API.
    - **Docker:** For containerizing the application.
    - **AWS/Heroku:** For deploying the Docker container to the cloud.
