    st.write("""
    In the fast-evolving field of data science, managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle can be challenging. From tracking experiments to ensuring reproducibility and deploying models, the tasks are numerous and complex. This is where MLflow comes in—a powerful open-source platform designed to simplify the machine learning workflow.
    """)

    st.subheader("Why MLflow?")
    st.write("""
    As data scientists, we often deal with multiple models, parameters, and datasets, making it difficult to keep track of everything. We might experiment with different algorithms, fine-tune hyperparameters, or even try out various preprocessing techniques. Without a structured approach to manage these experiments, it’s easy to lose track of what worked and what didn’t. This is where MLflow shines.
    
    MLflow provides a unified platform to manage the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model. Whether you’re experimenting with different models, sharing your results with colleagues, or deploying your model into production, MLflow helps you streamline the process. The key benefits include:
    
    - **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow allows you to log and track various aspects of your experiments, such as hyperparameters, metrics, and models. This ensures that you can easily compare different runs and identify the best-performing models.
    
    - **Reproducibility**: With MLflow, you can easily reproduce past experiments. The platform records the exact parameters, code, and data used in each run, making it simple to replicate results.
    
    - **Model Management**: MLflow provides a central repository to store and manage your models. You can version your models, compare different versions, and keep track of how they were created.
    
    - **Deployment**: MLflow simplifies the deployment process by providing tools to package and deploy models in various environments, such as cloud services, Docker containers, and more.

    st.write("""
    Let's dive into how to set up MLflow in a local environment using VS Code and integrate it into our modeling code to track experiments.

    st.subheader("Step 1: Install MLflow")
    st.write("""
    Before we can start using MLflow, we need to install it.

    To install MLflow, open your terminal in VS Code and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install mlflow
    ```
    This will install MLflow and all its dependencies, allowing you to start using it in your projects.
    """)

    st.subheader("Step 2: Set Up MLflow in VS Code")
    st.write("""
    Now that MLflow is installed, let's configure it to track our experiments.

    - **Import MLflow**: Start by importing the necessary MLflow libraries in your Python script. MLflow provides a range of functions for tracking experiments, logging metrics, and saving models.
    ```python
    import mlflow
    import mlflow.sklearn
    ```

    - **Set the Tracking URI**: MLflow uses a tracking URI to determine where the experiment logs will be stored. By default, MLflow stores logs in a local directory, but you can also configure it to use a remote server.

    Set the tracking URI to a local directory where MLflow will store the experiment logs:
    ```python
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("file:///path/to/mlruns")
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/mlruns` with the path where you want to store the MLflow logs.

    st.subheader("Step 3: Start an MLflow Run")
    st.write("""
    To start tracking an experiment, wrap your modeling code inside an MLflow run. This allows MLflow to capture parameters, metrics, and models associated with the run.
    ```python
    with mlflow.start_run():
        # Your modeling code goes here
        # Example: Train a model, log parameters and metrics
        model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
        accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
        mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
        
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "random_forest_model")
    ```
    In this example, MLflow logs the number of estimators used in the `RandomForestClassifier`, the model's accuracy on the test set, and the trained model itself.
